#... FAST V1.1b : parameter file .........................................
# (updates by J. Aird, 2017)

#--- GENERAL INFORMATION -----------------------------------------------
#
# Please read this parameter file in detail, you can find all relevant 
# information here. Note that you have to adjust your input catalogs
# accordingly, otherwise FAST will not work properly!
#
# o Requirements:
#   - ~2.0 Gb memory (or more depending on the grid size)
#   - idl (make sure IDL is properly installed, with IDL_DIR defined)
#
# o The main (example_phot or example_spec) directory should contain 
#   the following files:
#   - Parameter file 
#   - [CATALOG].cat	   If you fit broadband photometry
#   - [CATALOG].zout 	   If you input photometric redshifts
#   - [CATALOG].translate  If you input a translate file
#   - [FILTERS_RES]	   If you fit broadband photometry 
#   - [SPECTRUM].spec	   If you fit spectra
#
# o FAST can be run from the command line in the example directory. 
#   The first argument is the parameter file. Default is 'fast.param' 
#   $ ../fast		
#   $ ../fast my_fast.param
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 

#--- BROADBAND PHOTOMETRIC INFORMATION ---------------------------------
#
# o [CATALOG].cat (similar as for eazy):
#   - Example catalog: hdfn_fs99.cat 
#   - FAST recognizes columns with names {id,ID,z_spec,F[n],E[n],
#     TOT[n]} with n the number of the filter
#   - Column names in the original header or in the translate file
#     that have no flux information cannot start with "F" or "E"
#   - If z_spec is not given or any negative value, no z_spec is assumed
#   - Give -99 if the object has no coverage in a certain band
#
# o [CATALOG].zout (preferably generated with eazy):
#   - Example catalog: hdfn_fs99.zout
#   - If NAME_ZPHOT is not defined, FAST reads columns with labels "z_phot" 
#     as best-fit photometric redshifts "l68/l95/l99" and "h68/h95/h99"  
#     for the confidence intervalst
#   - If input photo-z is a negative value, the galaxy will not be fitted 
#   - If [CATALOG].zout is not available, and no z_specs are given in 
#     [CATALOG].cat, then the redshifts are allowed to float
#   - You can also read in spectroscopic redshifts from [CATALOG].zout. 
#     The corresponding column should be labeled "z_spec". However, if you 
#     list them in [CATALOG].cat, FAST will ignore those in [CATALOG].zout
#
# o [CATALOG].translate: 
#   - Example file: hdfn_fs99.translate 
#   - Translates the column names in [CATALOG].cat to the required 
#     F[n],E[n],etc formats
#   - Will only be used when available
#
# o AB_ZEROPOINT: m_AB = AB_ZEROPOINT - 2.5*log(F[n]) (Default: 25.)
#   - Default: AB_ZEROPOINT = 25.
#   - fluxes in microjanskys: AB_ZEROPOINT = 23.93
#   - fluxes in erg sec^{-1} cm^{-2} Hz^{-1}:  AB_ZEROPOINT = -48.57
#
# o FILTERS_RES: similar as for eazy
#
# o FILTER_FORMAT: tells the program in the response curves provided in 
#   filters_res file are determined for energy-counting (=0) or photon-
#   counting (=1) detectors (Default: 1)
#
# o TEMP_ERR_FILE: Template error function. The photometric errors are 
#   in rest-frame multiplied by this function. Note that this function
#   will not change the spectroscopic uncertainties.
#
# o NAME_ZPHOT: Header name of the column in your [CATALOG].zout file 
#   that you want to use for your photometric redshifts. If not defined, 
#   FAST will look for 'z_phot'
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CATALOG        = 'example_agn'
AB_ZEROPOINT   = 25. 			
FILTERS_RES    = '../Filters/FILTER.RES.v8.R300'
FILTER_FORMAT  = 1
TEMP_ERR_FILE  = '../Template_error/TEMPLATE_ERROR.AGN.v0.1'
NAME_ZPHOT     = 'zbest' 
		


#--- SPECTROSCOPIC INFORMATION -----------------------------------------
#
# o SPECTRUM: 
#   - Example file: "1030_gnirs.spec"
#   - The file should have the following format:
#     # bin wl tr F[id1] E[id1] F[id2] E[id2] ...
#   - bin: number of the bin in which the spectral element falls
#   - wl: wavelength is in Angstrom
#   - tr: transmission of spectral element, choose from 1 (not-masked) 
#     or 0 (masked). No intermediate values are allowed (yet).
#     The total transmission of the bin cannot be zero, so you can 
#     only mask certain parts within a bin
#   - (e)fl: in 10^-19 ergs s-1 cm-2 Angstrom-1 (if AUTO_SCALE=0)
#   - id: should be an integer
#   - If you want to fit spectra and photometry at the same time, only 
#     the objects for which both spectra AND photometry are provided
#     will be fit. Note that when you fit only one or a few galaxies
#     from the same field, you can feed the full photometric catalog, 
#     and FAST will find the corresponding photometry.
#   - Photometric redshifts are ignored when spectra are included.
#   - The value -99 as a non-detection is NOT recognized for spectra.
#   - It is advisable to keep the wavelength spacing constant and in 
#     small steps, as in the example input file! 
#
# o AUTO_SCALE: This option automatically scales the spectrum using the
#   broadband photometry as provided in the [CATALOG].cat file. The 
#   error on the scaling is taken into account when deriving the 
#   confidence intervals. The photometric bands used to scale the 
#   spectrum are not included in the fit. The scaling factor will be 
#   stored in the grid file, thus you have to set "SAVE_CHI_GRID" to "1"
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECTRUM       = ''
AUTO_SCALE     = 0			# 0 / 1


#--- OUTPUT INFORMATION  -----------------------------------------------
#
# o OUTPUT_DIR: output directory for results  
#
# o OUTPUT_FILE: output file for results. 
#   If not given: [CATALOG]_[SPECTRUM].fout
#
# o N_SIM: The number of monte carlo simulations used to calibrate the
#   confidence levels. If zero or not defined, only best-fit values will 
#   be given. 
#
# o C_INTERVAL: Percentage of confidence intervals, choose from 68% (1 
#   sigma), 95% (2 sigma), or 99% (3 sigma)
# **N.B. confidence intervals not implemented for AGN fits**
#
# o BEST_FIT: output best-fit SPS model
#   
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTPUT_DIR     = ''
OUTPUT_FILE    = ''
N_SIM          = 0
C_INTERVAL     = 68			# 68 / 95 / 99 or [68,95] etc
BEST_FIT       = 1			# 0 / 1


#--- CHOOSE STELLAR POPULATIONS LIBRARY --------------------------------
#
# o LIBRARY_DIR: directory containing the stellar population libraries
#   of the form: ised_[SFH].[resolutions]. 
#   The binaries in these directories are of the following form:
#   [library]_[resolution]_[imf]_z[metallicity]_ltau[ltau/yr].ised
#
# o All binary inputs are made using "csp_galaxev"
#   ("galaxev" software by Bruzual & Charlot 2003) on the SSP models
#   "bc2003_[RESOLUTION]_[metal]_[IMF]_ssp.ised" and assuming no dust 
#   law (and no recycling of gas ejected by stars for exponentially 
#   declining star formation history)
#
# o LIBRARY: choose from Bruzual & Charlot 2003 ('bc03'), 
#   Maraston 2005 ('ma05'), and FSPS by Conroy et al. ('co11')
# 
# o RESOLUTION: Choose 'hr' for spectral fitting, and 'pr' (photometric 
#   resolution) or 'lr' for medium and broadband filters. Not all 
#   resolutions are standard available for all SFHs or libraries or IMFs
#
# o IMF (stellar initial mass function), choose from 
#   - 'ch'(abrier)
#   - 'sa'(lpeter)
#   - 'kr'(oupa)
#
# o SFH: parametrization of the star formation history (SFH), choose from
#   - 'exp': exponentially declining SFH; sfr ~ exp(-t/tau)
#   - 'del': delayed exponentially declining SFH; sfr ~ t exp(-t/tau)
#   - 'tru': truncated SFH, with constant star formation between
#            t_onset and t_onset+tau
#   For all SFH you can specify the range tau in the grid  
# 
# o DUST_LAW: parametrization of the dust attenuation curve. You can
#   choose from the following options
#   - 'calzetti': Calzetti (2000) dust law
#   - 'mw': Milky Way, following parametrization by Cardelli et al. (1989)
#   - 'kc': Kriek & Conroy (2013). Average dust law. We use the 
#      parametrization by Noll et al. with E_B = 1 and delta = -0.1
#   - 'noll': For this law you have to parametrize E_b and delta.
#      You can only pick one value for each, arrays are not allowed.
#
# o MY_SFH: if you define this option, FAST will not fit a range of
#   star-formation histories, but just one model (so LOG_TAU_XXX will 
#   be ignored). For this option you can only read in one custom star
#   formation history, for which you have to make the ISED file
#   yourself using "csp_galaxev". The naming of the ised file has to 
#   be as follows:
#   [library]_[resolution]_[imf]_z[metallicity]_[MY_SFH].ised
#   This file needs to be placed directly in 'LIBRARY_DIR'
#

#--- DEFINE GRID -------------------------------------------------------
#
# o Choose only values for tau and metallicity that are in your library.
#   Otherwise extend your library.
#
# o If EAZY is used, make sure Z_MIN, Z_MAX are similar.
#
# o METAL: the options differ per stellar population library
#   ma05: Z=0.001, Z=0.01, Z=0.02 [solar], and Z=0.04
#   bc03: Z=0.004, Z=0.008, Z=0.02 [solar], and Z=0.05
#   co11: Z=0.0008, Z=0.0031, Z=0.0096, Z=0.019 [solar], and Z=0.03
#   You can choose more than one by defining an array.
#
# o If a grid has already been made for a specific LIBRARY, RESOLUTION, 
#   IMF, tau, age, z, A_v, metallicity, and filter set and/or spectral 
#   elements, the grid will be automatically read from the "tmp" 
#   directory.
#
# o NO_MAX_AGE: By default (0), ages that exceed the age of the universe 
#   are not allowed. However, when NO_MAX_AGE is put to 1 you can have
#   older ages.
